# This file is used to generate a XOR file from 2 files
# Usage:
#   klayout -b -r xor.drc -rd gds1=a.gds -rd gds2=b.gds -rd out=out.gds

l1 = layout($gds1)
l2 = layout($gds2)

target($out, $out)

File.write("report.drc", "# Get Report of XOR\n\nsource($input)\nreport(\"XOR runset\", \"#{File.basename($gds1, ".*")}_xor.lyrdb\")\n\n")

layers = []
[ l1, l2 ].each do |l|
  l.layout.layer_indices.each do |index|
    info = l.layout.get_info(index)
    layers << [info.layer, info.datatype ]
  end
end

# collect layers
layers.sort.uniq.each do |l,d|
  log "Running XOR between #{l}/#{d} .."
  (l1.input(l, d) ^ l2.input(l, d)).output(l, d)
  File.write("report.drc", "l#{l}_#{d} = polygons(#{l},#{d})\n", mode: "a")
  File.write("report.drc", "l#{l}_#{d}.output(\"l#{l}_#{d}\",\"l#{l}_#{d}\")\n", mode: "a")
end
